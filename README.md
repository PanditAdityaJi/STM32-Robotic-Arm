# STM32-Robotic-Arm
## Overview
This project is a robotic arm controlled by an STM32 microcontroller. The system is designed for precision movement and automation, leveraging embedded firmware and real-time control algorithms.

## Features
#### Microcontroller: STM32-based control system

#### Degrees of Freedom: 6-DOF

#### Motor Control: Servo motors

#### Communication: UART, I2C, SPI interfaces

#### Sensors: IMU, limit switches, encoders

#### Control Modes: Manual, automated, and remote control

## Hardware Requirements
#### STM32F4xx Microcontroller

#### MG996R Servo Motors

#### PWM Servo Driver (e.g., PCA9685)

#### Power Supply (e.g., 12V DC Adapter)

#### IMU Sensor (e.g., MPU6050)

## Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE / Keil / PlatformIO

Embedded C/C++

FreeRTOS

Python

### Control Modes:
 Manual Mode: Use buttons or joystick to control the arm.

## Automated Mode: Predefined movement sequences.

## Remote Control: Interface with a PC or mobile app via UART or Bluetooth.
